1. Get the status of your dataset download job:

   kubectl get job {{ include "dataset-download.fullname" . }}

2. Follow the download progress:

   kubectl logs -f job/{{ include "dataset-download.fullname" . }}

3. Check if the dataset was created successfully:

   kubectl exec -it job/{{ include "dataset-download.fullname" . }} -- ls -la {{ .Values.storage.dataPath }}

4. Once complete, you can use the dataset for training with:

   Dataset path: {{ .Values.storage.dataPath }}
   Shared storage PVC: {{ .Values.storage.pvcName }}

5. Storage configuration:
   - Shared PVC: {{ .Values.storage.pvcName }}
   - Mount path: {{ .Values.storage.dataPath }}

6. To clean up the download job:

   helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }}

Note: This chart uses shared storage created by the shared-storage helm chart.
Make sure the shared-storage chart is installed first with the same PVC name.
