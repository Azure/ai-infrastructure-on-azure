# Affinity configuration for worker pods
# This controls pod placement to ensure optimal network topology
affinity:
  # Required affinity rules (must be satisfied)
  # Default: ensures all workers are in the same agentpool
  required:
    - topologyKey: agentpool
  
  # Preferred affinity rules (best effort)
  # Default: empty (no preferred affinity)
  # Example: To prefer same torset, add:
  #   - topologyKey: ib/torset
  #     weight: 100
  preferred: []
