1. Get the status of your Azure Node Health Check job:

   kubectl get job {{ include "aznhc.fullname" . }}

2. Check the health check results from all nodes:

   kubectl logs -l task={{ include "aznhc.fullname" . }}

3. Check for any failures across all nodes:

   kubectl logs -l task={{ include "aznhc.fullname" . }} | grep -i fail

4. Get detailed status of individual pods:

   kubectl get pods -l task={{ include "aznhc.fullname" . }}

5. Check logs from a specific pod:

   kubectl logs <pod-name>

6. Monitor job completion:

   kubectl wait --for=condition=complete --timeout=600s job/{{ include "aznhc.fullname" . }}

The health check will test GPU, InfiniBand, and system components on each node.
Each pod should complete successfully if the node passes all health checks.
